- 👋 Hi, I’m @AggieSigGuy
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation to make life easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about protocols and related hardware.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... ask me once I've had a little time to digest home automation.
- 📫 How to reach me - no good way at the moment.
- 😄 Pronouns: the usual ones for a cis male.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an engineer looking for a new hobby.
